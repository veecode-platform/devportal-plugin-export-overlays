# Upload Istanbul/lcov coverage to Codecov, attributed to THIS repo's commit.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/upload-coverage.sh <workspace-name> [lcov-file]
#
# Example:
#   E2E_COLLECT_COVERAGE=true ./run-e2e.sh -w tech-radar
#   ./scripts/upload-coverage.sh tech-radar coverage/tech-radar/lcov.info
#
# lcov-file defaults to coverage/lcov.info (the combined report, for manual
# invocations); report-coverage.sh always passes the per-workspace lcov
# written by remap-coverage.cjs so each `e2e-<workspace>` flag only carries
# its own workspace's data.
#
# Coverage is uploaded to the Codecov project of this overlay repo
# (redhat-developer/rhdh-plugin-export-overlays), flagged `e2e-<workspace>`,
# against the overlay commit currently being tested. Earlier versions attributed
# coverage to the upstream source repo + the historical `repo-ref` commit from
# source.json, but Codecov finalizes a commit's report shortly after that
# commit's own CI completes — uploads to an already-finalized historical commit
# are accepted by the API and never displayed. Uploading to the fresh overlay
# commit keeps the data live, avoids needing other orgs' tokens, and keeps
# RHDH-specific E2E numbers off upstream community dashboards.
#
# Trade-off: this repo does not contain the plugin source files, so Codecov
# cannot render line-level annotations — only the per-flag coverage percentage
# and its trend, which is the metric we want from E2E runs.
#
# Required environment:
#   CODECOV_TOKEN       - Codecov upload token for this repo's project.
#                         Falls back to VAULT_CODECOV_TOKEN (see below).
# Optional environment:
#   CODECOV_UPLOAD_SLUG - GitHub slug of the Codecov project to upload to.
#                         Default: redhat-developer/rhdh-plugin-export-overlays.
#   PULL_PULL_SHA       - PR head SHA (set by Prow presubmits).
#   PULL_NUMBER         - PR number (set by Prow presubmits).
#   PULL_BASE_REF       - Base branch (set by Prow postsubmits) — used as the
#                         upload branch when there is no PR number.
#   GITHUB_SHA          - Commit SHA (set by GitHub Actions).
#   GIT_PR_NUMBER       - PR number fallback (exported by the E2E CI step).
