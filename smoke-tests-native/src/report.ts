/**
 * Bump when the results.json shape changes.
 *
 * isReport/isSweepSummary below require an EXACT match, so every bump is breaking for
 * every consumer even when the shape only grew — update them in the same change. The
 * full consumer list, so the next bump starts from a checklist rather than a guess:
 *
 * - `sweep.ts`, via isReport, on each per-workspace results file.
 * - `aggregate.ts` via isSweepSummary, and `aggregate-report.ts` which reads
 *   `report.frontend.bundles[]` and `report.backend.bundleErrors[]`.
 *
 * That is the whole list of code consumers. Three workflows move these files as
 * artifacts without reading `schemaVersion`, so a bump does not break them — but
 * `catalog-index-sanity.yaml` jq's FIELDS out of a report (`catalogIndex.*`,
 * `backend.*`, `frontend.*`) for its summary, so renaming one degrades that to nulls
 * silently. The sweep never reads a shard artifact across runs.
 *
 * 2: added `exclusions` and the support/exclusion fields on `workspace`.
 * 3: added `installShortfall` and the `fail-install` status.
 * 4: added `mf` on each frontend bundle (module-federation remote shape).
 * 5: added `mf.nfsFeaturesError`, so a failure to read backstage.features is not
 *    recorded as the artifact declaring none.
 * 6: added `scalprum` and `configSchema` on each frontend bundle (RHIDP-16229).
 * 7: added `catalogIndex`, the provenance block catalog-index mode records.
 * 8: added `backend.bundles` and `backend.bundleErrors`, extending the configSchema
 *    check of 6 to backend plugins (RHIDP-16689).
 * 9: added `frontend.configKeyMismatches` (RHIDP-16690).
