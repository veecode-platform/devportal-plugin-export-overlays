 * ship legacy Scalprum plugins — so it overstates. But the obvious correction,
 * "count it only when `nfsFeaturesExposed` is non-empty", understates by exactly as
 * much: that array is empty both when a package declares entry points its remote never
 * exposes *and* when it declares no `backstage.features` at all, and those are not the
 * same fact.
 *
 * `describeNfsShortfall` in harness-logic.ts already draws that line and explains why:
 * with `backstage.features` absent, RHDH's `nfsModuleFilter` installs no filter at all,
 * the router advertises every exposed module, and the dynamic feature loader decides at
 * runtime from each module's `$$type`. Whether NFS mounts anything then cannot be known
 * without executing the bundle. Over the 2026-08-21 community sweep that is the state of
 * 27 of 47 bundles — ten of which expose an `alpha` module, the same shape as bundles
 * that are unambiguously NFS. Publishing those as legacy would be a guess stated as a
