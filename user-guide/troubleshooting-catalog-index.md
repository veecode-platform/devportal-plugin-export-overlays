## Troubleshooting

Common issues reported on the status page and how to resolve them.

### Backstage version mismatch

**What it means:** The plugin's workspace targets an older Backstage minor version than the one expected by the current branch.

**Common cause:** The upstream plugin repository has not yet released a version compatible with the latest Backstage version, or the workspace's `source.json` `repo-ref` points to an older tag.

**What to do:**

1. Check if a newer tag or commit exists in the upstream repo that supports the required Backstage version.
2. If a workspace update PR exists in the overlays, try commenting `/update-commit` to pull the latest compatible ref.
3. If no compatible version exists upstream, add a `backstage.json` override in the workspace to pin the version.

### Plugin marked as outdated

**What it means:** The exact requested image tag couldn't be found. Instead the latest published tag for the same Backstage/RHDH version line is being used as a fallback. The plugin is still included in the catalog index rather than being removed entirely.

**When this happens:**

- The plugin version in metadata was bumped (e.g., `1.2.0` → `1.3.0`) but the export/publish workflow hasn't run yet for the new plugin version.
- For example:
  - The requested tag is `bs_1.49.4__1.3.0` but only `bs_1.49.4__1.2.0` is published — the older tag is used.
  - The requested tag is `1.11-0.5.2` but only `1.11-0.4.6` and `1.11-0.4.5` are published, then `1.11-0.4.6` is used.

**What to do:**

1. Check whether the publish workflow has run successfully for this plugin.
2. Trigger the export/publish workflow for the plugin to publish the plugin with the updated tag.

If this fallback also fails (no older tag exists), the plugin will instead appear as [Image not found in registry](#image-not-found-in-registry).

### Image not found in registry

**What it means:** No OCI image exists in the container registry for *any* tag matching the plugin's Backstage or RHDH version. The pipeline has no image to use — not even an older one to fall back to (see [Outdated](#plugin-marked-as-outdated)) — so the plugin is excluded from the catalog index entirely.

**When this happens:**

- A plugin is newly onboarded for the specified backstage/RHDH version and the export/publish workflow has never run for it yet.
- For example, a plugin may have been updated from `bs_1.45.3` to `bs_1.49.4` and now expects `bs_1.49.4__1.2.0` and it might not have been published yet as no `bs_1.49.4_*` tags exist yet. Even if a tag like `bs_1.45.3__1.1.1` exists, it will not be considered for the fallback.

**What to do:**

1. Check whether the publish workflow has run successfully for this plugin.
2. Trigger the export/publish workflow for the plugin to publish the plugin with the updated tag.

### Image not found during catalog index generation

> **Note:** This is the same "Image not found" error as above, but detected during the final Catalog Index Generation step rather than during Image Metadata Fetch. It serves as a redundancy check which normally should never happen— if you see this, the image was likely deleted or became unavailable after the metadata fetch stage. Re-run the workflow to see if this persists, as it may be a transient registry issue. The resolution steps are the same as [Image not found in registry](#image-not-found-in-registry).
