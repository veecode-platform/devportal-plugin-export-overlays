# Getting Started with the Overlay Repository

## What is this Repository?

The `rhdh-plugin-export-overlays` repository serves as a **metadata and automation hub** for managing dynamic plugins for Backstage-based platforms. It acts as a bridge between upstream source code and deployable OCI artifacts.

### What the Overlay Repository Provides

1. **References** plugins from various Backstage ecosystem sources
2. **Tracks** plugin versions for compatibility with target platform releases
3. **Automates** the discovery, packaging, and publishing of dynamic plugins
4. **Customizes** builds via patches and overlays when upstream code needs modification

## Core Concepts

### Workspace

A **workspace** maps to a source repository (or a workspace within a monorepo). Each workspace folder contains all configuration needed to build and publish plugins from that source.

**Example:** `workspaces/backstage/` maps to `https://github.com/backstage/backstage`

### source.json

Defines where to fetch the source code:

```json
{
  "repo": "https://github.com/backstage/backstage",
  "repo-ref": "v1.45.3",
  "repo-flat": true,
  "repo-backstage-version": "1.45.3"
}
```

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `repo` | GitHub repository URL |
| `repo-ref` | Git tag or commit SHA |
| `repo-flat` | `true` = plugins at repo root; `false` = plugins in workspace subfolder |
| `repo-backstage-version` | Backstage version used by the source |

### plugins-list.yaml

Lists plugins to export with optional CLI arguments:

```yaml
plugins/catalog-backend-module-github:
plugins/catalog-backend-module-github-org: --embed-package @backstage/plugin-catalog-backend-module-github
plugins/techdocs-backend: --embed-package @backstage/plugin-search-backend-module-techdocs --suppress-native-package cpu-features
#plugins/scaffolder: ==> Included as a static plugin in the host application
```

- **Commented lines** (prefixed with `#`) indicate plugins intentionally excluded
- **CLI arguments** after the colon customize the export behavior (e.g., `--embed-package`, `--shared-package`)

> 📖 **CLI Reference:** For detailed documentation on all export CLI flags (`--embed-package`, `--shared-package`, `--suppress-native-package`, etc.), see the official documentation:
> [Export Derived Dynamic Plugin Package](https://github.com/redhat-developer/rhdh/blob/main/docs/dynamic-plugins/export-derived-package.md)

### Metadata Files

Each plugin requires a `Package` entity definition in `metadata/*.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: extensions.backstage.io/v1alpha1
kind: Package
metadata:
  name: backstage-plugin-catalog-backend-module-github
  namespace: default
  title: "Catalog Backend Module GitHub"
spec:
  packageName: "@backstage/plugin-catalog-backend-module-github"
  version: 0.8.5
  backstage:
    role: backend-plugin-module
    supportedVersions: 1.42.5
  author: Your Organization
  support: community
  lifecycle: active
```

## Branching Strategy

| Branch | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `main` | Development branch for the **next** platform release |
| `release-x.y` | Long-running branches for specific platform versions (e.g., `release-1.6`) |

> **Rule:** New workspaces are **only** added to `main`. Release branches receive plugin updates only, and have no scheduled automatic updates — they must be triggered manually.

---

## Adding a New Plugin

### Prerequisites

1. Plugin exists in a supported source repository:
   - [`@backstage-community/`](https://github.com/backstage/community-plugins) – Backstage Community Plugins
   - [`@red-hat-developer-hub/`](https://github.com/redhat-developer/rhdh-plugins) – RHDH Plugins
   - [`@roadiehq/`](https://github.com/RoadieHQ/roadie-backstage-plugins) – Roadie Backstage Plugins
2. Plugin is compatible with the target Backstage version

### How Automatic Updates and Discovery Work

The overlay repository runs an automated workflow (`update-plugins-repo-refs.yaml`) **daily on the `main` branch only**. It operates in two complementary modes:

#### 1. Overlay-first package enumeration (all existing workspaces)

The workflow enumerates all existing workspaces directly from the overlay repository, reads each workspace's `source.json`, and scans the source repository tree to discover plugin package names. It then queries npm (`npm view`) for each discovered package to find published versions and check Backstage compatibility. This works for **any workspace regardless of npm scope** — once a workspace is added to the overlay, it will receive automatic version updates. What's avoided is the regexp-based `npm search` step for package name discovery.

#### 2. npm search discovery (new packages)

The workflow also runs `npm search` to discover new packages matching the scope patterns defined in the `workspace-discovery-include` file:

- `@backstage-community/`
- `@red-hat-developer-hub/`
- `@roadiehq/`

When a new release is found that doesn't correspond to an existing workspace, the workflow can propose adding a new workspace (on `main` only, with `allow-workspace-addition` enabled).

#### Where automatic updates work

- **All existing workspaces** are updated automatically regardless of their npm scope. This includes third-party plugins (e.g., `@immobiliarelabs/`, `@pagerduty/`, `@dynatrace/`) as long as they have a workspace in the overlay.
- **Plugins under the auto-discovery scopes** are additionally scanned on npm, enabling discovery of new workspaces.

#### Where automatic discovery does not work

- **Plugins outside the supported scopes** (e.g., `@pagerduty/`, `@dynatrace/`, or any other third-party namespace), which are part of new workspaces, are not discovered automatically. They must be added manually. However, once added, they **are** updated automatically.
- **Workspaces listed in `workspace-discovery-exclude`** are skipped entirely by the scheduled run.
- **Unpublished or pre-release versions** that are not yet on npm will not be discovered.
- **New workspaces** are only proposed when the scheduled workflow has the `allow-workspace-addition` flag enabled; otherwise only existing workspaces receive updates.

### Option 1: Automatic Updates (Preferred, `main` only)

If your workspace already exists in the overlay, the daily automation on `main` will detect new published versions and create a PR automatically. No action is needed on your part. For release branches, use Option 2.

### Option 2: Trigger Workflow Manually

You can trigger the update workflow on demand. The two main inputs serve different purposes:

| Input | Purpose | When to use |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `workspace-path` | Update a specific existing workspace | Preferred for updates — works for any scope |
| `regexps` | Discover new plugins via npm search | For adding workspaces not yet in the overlay |

> **Important:** When `workspace-path` is set, only that workspace is updated (no npm search runs). When only `regexps` is provided, ALL existing workspaces are updated via overlay-first enumeration, and then npm search runs additionally to discover new workspaces.

#### Update an existing workspace (preferred)

Use `workspace-path` to target a specific workspace. This uses overlay-first enumeration and works for **any workspace regardless of npm scope**. Use `single-branch` to target a specific branch (required for release branches, which have no scheduled updates):

```bash
# Update on main
gh workflow run update-plugins-repo-refs.yaml \
  -f workspace-path="workspaces/your-workspace" \
  -f single-branch="main"

# Update on a release branch
gh workflow run update-plugins-repo-refs.yaml \
  -f workspace-path="workspaces/your-workspace" \
  -f single-branch="release-1.6"
```

This reads the workspace's `source.json`, scans its source repo for plugin package names, then queries npm for published versions and creates/updates PRs for any new compatible versions.

#### Add a new workspace via discovery

Use `regexps` with `allow-workspace-addition` to discover and add a new plugin not yet in the overlay. **Wrapping a value in single quotes** tells the workflow to treat it as an exact (literal) package name rather than a regular expression:

```bash
# Add a specific new plugin by exact name (note the single quotes)
gh workflow run update-plugins-repo-refs.yaml \
  -f regexps="'@backstage-community/plugin-your-plugin'" \
  -f single-branch="main" \
  -f allow-workspace-addition=true

# Discover multiple new packages matching a regex pattern
gh workflow run update-plugins-repo-refs.yaml \
  -f regexps="@backstage-community/plugin-catalog-backend-module-.*" \
  -f single-branch="main" \
  -f allow-workspace-addition=true
```

> **Note:** Running with `regexps` alone (without `workspace-path`) also updates all existing workspaces as a side effect, since overlay-first enumeration always runs first.

### Option 3: Manual PR (Fallback)

Manual PRs should be reserved for situations where automatic discovery does not apply — for example, plugins outside the supported scopes or workspaces that require nonstandard setup. Prefer Options 1 or 2 whenever possible.

1. **Create workspace folder:**

   ```bash
   mkdir -p workspaces/your-plugin
   ```

2. **Add `source.json`:**

   ```json
   {
     "repo": "https://github.com/backstage/community-plugins",
     "repo-ref": "@backstage-community/plugin-your-plugin@1.0.0",
     "repo-flat": false,
     "repo-backstage-version": "1.45.0"
   }
   ```

3. **Add `plugins-list.yaml`:**

   ```yaml
   plugins/your-plugin:
   plugins/your-plugin-backend:
   ```

4. **Add metadata files in `metadata/`:**

   Create one YAML file per plugin following the Package schema.

5. **Open PR against `main`**

## Testing Your Plugin

### Trigger a Build

Comment on your PR:

```
/publish
```

This builds and publishes test OCI artifacts tagged as `pr_<number>__<version>`.

### Run Smoke Tests

After `/publish` completes, smoke tests run automatically if:
- PR touches exactly one workspace
- At least one published plugin has runnable metadata

Published plugins without runnable metadata are skipped individually. Smoke tests are skipped only when no published plugin in the workspace can produce runnable metadata, or when plugin config references environment variables and the workspace `smoke-tests/test.env` file is missing. If the file exists but required variables are missing from it, the workflow fails instead of skipping.

To re-run smoke tests manually:

```
/smoketest
```

Plugin-specific configuration is extracted from `spec.appConfigExamples[0].content` in each plugin's metadata file and placed under `pluginConfig` in the generated config. The optional workspace-level `app-config.test.yaml` is for test-only or shared workspace settings. If a plugin's config references environment variables (e.g., `${API_TOKEN}`), provide them in `workspaces/<ws>/smoke-tests/test.env`.

### Manual Testing

Use the OCI references from the bot's comment to test in your own Backstage instance:

```yaml
# dynamic-plugins.yaml
plugins:
  - package: oci://ghcr.io/redhat-developer/rhdh-plugin-your-plugin:pr_123__1.0.0
    disabled: false
```
